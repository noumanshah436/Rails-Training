# The main difference between the protected and private methods is that protected methods are accessible from inside the class by using an explicit receiver while private methods are not.
# Example:


# Ruby program to demonstrate that private
# and protected method can't be accessed
# outside the class even after inheritance

class Geeks

	# public method
	def method_1
	
		p "Public Method of class Geeks"
	
	end

	# defining the protected method
	protected

	def method_2
		
		p "Protected Method of class Geeks"
	end

	# defining the private method
	private

	def method_3
		
		p "Private Method of class Geeks"
		
	end
end

# Sudo class inheriting Geeks class
class Sudo < Geeks
	
	# public method of Sudo class
	def method_4
		
		p "Public Method of Sudo Class"
		
	
	
		# calling the public method
		# of Geeks class
		method_1

		# creating object of class Sudo
		# inside the public method of
		# class Sudo
		obj_inside_sudo = Sudo.new

		# calling the protected
		# method of class Geeks
		obj_inside_sudo.method_2
		
		# calling the private
		# method of class Geeks
		# using an explicit receiver
		obj_inside_sudo.method_3 rescue p "You can't Access!"
        		
	end
end



# creating an object of class Sudo
obj_sudo = Sudo.new

# calling the public method
# of class Sudo
obj_sudo.method_4
