# There are different types of variables in Ruby:
# Local variables
# Instance variables
# Class variables
# Global variables

# Each variable in Ruby is declared by using a special character at the start of the variable name which is mentioned in the following table:

# **************************** 

# Symbol	      Type of Variable
# [a-z] or _	  Local Variable
# @	            Instance Variable
# @@	          Class Variable
# $	            Global Variable

# Local Variables: A local variable name always starts with a lowercase letter(a-z) or underscore (_).
# These variables are local to the code construct in which they are declared.
# A local variable is only accessible within the block of its initialization.
# Local variables are not available outside the method. There is no need to initialize the local variables.

# Example:

# age = 10
# _Age = 20
