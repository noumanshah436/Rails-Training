# class methods are methods defined on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. 
# They can be useful for various tasks, such as utility functions, data queries, or business logic that doesnâ€™t pertain to a single instance

# ************************

# Syntax:

# def class_name.class_method_name or self.class_method_name
#   # some code
# end

# Here, we can access the above method there is no need to create objects of the Class as we can directly access it.
# Here, the self keyword refers to the entire class itself, not to an instance of the class.
# In this case, we are inside the class only, not inside an instance method of that class. So, we are in the class scope.

# Program in Ruby for a count of total Grocery items

class Grocery
  # class variable
  @@total_count = 0

  # class array
  @@items_list = []

  def add_item(item)
    # adding item to the array
    @@items_list.push(item)
    @@total_count += 1 # counting
  end

  def print_items # only accessible through objects
    puts "Total number of items --> #{@@total_count}"
    puts "All items --> #{@@items_list}"
  end

  # class method (direct access)
  def self.printitems_only       # or Grocery.printitems_only
    puts "\nGrocery.printitems_only", @@items_list.join("\n")
  end
end

list = Grocery.new

list.add_item('shampoo')
list.add_item('face wash')
list.add_item('serum')
list.add_item('mud pack')
list.add_item('tea tree oil')
list.add_item('toner')

list.print_items

# direct access
Grocery.printitems_only

# throws an error
# list.printitems_only

# *************************************

# In def self.printitems_only, the keyword self denotes that the method printitems_only is being defined in the context of the Class itself, not its instances.
#  Any method definition without the self qualifier is by default an instance method.


# Class methods do not have access to instance methods or instance variables.
# However instance methods can access both class methods and class variables.
